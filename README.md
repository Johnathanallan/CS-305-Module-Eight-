#Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

Artemis Financial is  is a financial services company that prioritizes secure digital solutions for handling sensitive customer data and transactions. They want to make sure there is no unauthorized access. They wanted me to address to incorporate security to ensure that the information that is being transferred is secure. I identified key vulnerabilities in the codebase using static testing tools like OWASP Dependency-Check. 

#What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

What I did well when i found my client's software security vulnerabilities was performing a dependency check to detect outdated or vulnerable libraries, carefully reviewing the code for insecure practices, and documenting all findings with clarity. It is important to code securley because it helps prevent data breaches, unauthorized access, and exploitation of systems. Secure code protects user data, ensures compliance with industry regulations, and reduces long-term maintenance costs. The value that adds to a company's overall well being is that by safeguarding its reputation, building customer trust, and maintaining the integrity and availability of services.

#Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The part that was challenging to me was interpreting complex vulnerability reports and determining which issues were critical versus low risk. However, this process also taught me how to analyze security data and prioritize remediation efforts effectively.

#How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I increased layers of security by refactoring the code to follow secure coding practices, removed unsafe dependencies, and validated input handling. In the future I would keep using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check to assess vulnerabilities. 

#How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I made certain by testing it thoroughly. After refactoring I would check by rerunning the dependency scan to confirm that no new vulnerabilities had been introduced, and I also conducted functional testing to validate expected behaviors. 

#What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Tools that I used were the OWASP Dependency-Check and I documented my findings and resolutions. This is all improtant steps to take that I would use in the future. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

What I might show in the future is how I can show my ability to perform a full software vulnerability assessment, implement secure coding practices, and validate a working, secure software product.
